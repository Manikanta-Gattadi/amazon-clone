Got it 👍 Since your **Amazon Clone app is only the frontend (HTML, CSS, maybe some basic JS)** and not fully functional, here’s a clean **README.md** tailored for your project:

# 🛒 Amazon Clone (Frontend Only)

This is a **basic Amazon clone frontend project** that replicates the look and feel of Amazon’s website. It focuses only on the **user interface (UI)** using **HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript**.
👉 Note: This project is **not fully functional** – features like authentication, cart, and payments are not implemented.

## 📌 Features

* Amazon-style **homepage layout**
* **Navigation bar** with logo, search bar, and menu
* **Product listing section** with images, prices, and descriptions
* **Cart icon** (UI only, no real functionality)
* **Footer section** similar to Amazon

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5** – Structure
* **CSS3** – Styling and layout (Flexbox/Grid)
* **JavaScript (basic)** – For minor interactions (optional)
